<!-- 
When the “Start countdown” button is pressed:
    The “Start Countdown” button is hidden
    A countdown downwards from 10 seconds with an interval of 1 second starts and is 
displayed on the page, in the defined div
    The color of the countdown text changes randomly every time it is updated. Note 
that a function which returns a random color is already provided to you in the 
JavaScript document. You can use this function to generate a random color, you do 
not need to write your own

When the countdown finishes:
    One random piece of data is imported and displayed from 
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/. The data is displayed in the 
countdown div as “id. title” where id is the “id” from the JSON data and title is the 
contents of the “title” field from the JSON data. The data imported needs to be 
truly random chosen between 1 – 100.
    Font size of the countdown div is shrunk to “100px” so the text is smaller and fits the 
screen
